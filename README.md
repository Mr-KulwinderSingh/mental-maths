Welcome to [Mental Maths!](https://mr-kulwindersingh.github.io/mental-maths/) game of numbers, this game is based on the concept of UK's popular show "Countdown" which usually broadcast on channel 4. But compare to that this game is much easier and made to learn and practice badsic maths. There is no hard mathematical formula is needed for this. Generally this game is played between two players to check their ability how good they are in maths. But a solo player can also play, so anybody who have interest in maths, are welcome to play with numbers and enjoy. Very simple instructions are also provided together with the more inforamtion about the game.

# Site Goal 

This game is developed with the aim to have fun with the easy and handy maths in the free time, there is no age restrictions and not very tough. The user can be any age group could be solo player or group of two or more.
Mental Maths works through the javaScript various methods and functions, but not getting too heavy on java, it is kind of good combination of Java and simple HTML and CSS design and targets the audience who love maths but not too much so that cannot handle. Basic maths who everybody studies in the their school time i.e addition, multiplication, division and subtraction, by this anybody would love to have a little challenge with their head. Basic design of the game is aiming the younger children 12 years of age but anybody of any age can play this game.

# Features

As the design is simple and attractive, in the game very simple and light theme has been used which is a contrast of light yellow "rgb(248, 246, 194)" and light blue rgb(0, 89, 255) colour. Throught the whole game limited number of colour have been used to keep the design simple and attractive.

# Responsiveness 

While developing the codes and designing the game it has been taken into special consideration that it should be responsive on all the screen size devices, therefor the responsiveness is good and tested via light house, even without adding any media queries it is responsive. But just to give it a better look on small screen devices it has been added. 



# Color Scheme

Colors given in rgb code for the future changes and easy to understand.

# Unfixed Bugs or Errors

As given per warning by Jshint I would look at it and fix it in future. 


# User Testing Stories 

As a first time user the site is opened a nice warm light yellow color, it has a layout to attract and a feeling of a kind of a game atmosphere, which is presented by a clear design, further there are options to move between the Home page and About Game easy navigation and quick and easily accessible buttons.

<ul>
<li>At the start a nice and attractive look, the title Mental Maths! this gives a hint the game is related to some mathematical operations.</li>
<li>The buttons has name and question digit number printed on them, via tapping the button and seeing the result in the output user get comfortable what is happening and what is next.</li>
<li>All the buttons are in the middle of the page and close to each other, easy to use on the small device as well.</li>
<li> Name of the buttons are appropriate according to the user understanding. Get-the-Target  and Reset are meaningful names.</li>
</lu>

As a first time user I want to see what other options are given and are they somewhere related to the social media, so for that purpose user friendly and iconic social media links available on the bottom of the page. Once the user likes the concept or the game he would definitely come back to it.

# Content 

<ul>The original idea is an influence from the UK's popular show "Countdown", it is very interesting topic and found it very much related to this project as JavaScript gave the opportunity to create something challenging. Which I loved to do</ul>
<ul>[Youtube](youtube.com) you can find a short clip of the real "Countdwon" show on youtube channel.</ul>
<ul>[Fontawesome](fontawesome.com)The icons of social media are more popular than their names so they have been taken from fontawesome.</ul>

# Credits 

Code Instituteâ€™s lessons and challenges itself is strong inspiration although doing JavaScript felt lost sometimes, and I am very thankful to my fellow students who helped me through slack, also time to time I got technical help from the Tutor Support by the [CodeInstitute](https://codeinstitute.net/ie/) Other than that [Google](https://www.google.com/) and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) are very useful sources throught the whole project.
